# Domain Model

- Ubiquitous language; enforce invariants in aggregates; publish domain events on state changes.
- Anti-corruption layer for external systems; explicit mapping between domain and external schemas.

# Service Boundaries

- Stable contracts; versioned APIs; avoid chatty sync calls; prefer async events for cross-boundary flows.
- True autonomy: data + deploy + runtime isolation; avoid distributed transactions; use outbox + transactional messaging.

# Documentation

- Maintain ADRs for significant decisions; C4 diagrams (Context/Container/Component); keep updated with releases.
