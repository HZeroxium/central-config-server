# Static Analysis
- Spotless for formatting; Checkstyle for conventions; SpotBugs/PMD/Error Prone for correctness/perf issues.
- Critical rules as errors; baseline file only for legacy repos with explicit TODO cleanup plan.

# Dependency Management
- Prefer BOMs; limit direct deps; prune unused; block deprecated/vulnerable libs; SCA scanning in CI.
- Document any `force`/`exclude` with rationale and ticket reference; periodic refresh of transitive graph.
