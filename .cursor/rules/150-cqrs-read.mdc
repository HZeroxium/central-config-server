# Read Models
- Use projections/DTOs; avoid loading full aggregates on queries; cache read views with explicit TTLs.
- For high read volumes, consider CQRS with denormalized stores updated by events.

# Reporting & Analytics
- Offload heavy analytics to separate pipelines or warehouses; prohibit long OLTP queries in request paths.
