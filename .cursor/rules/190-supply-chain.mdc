# Supply Chain

- Lock versions; verify checksums; trusted registries; SBOM generation; SCA/secret scanning as CI gates.
- Sign images/artifacts; provenance/attestations when supported; block on critical CVEs.

# Reproducibility

- Pin JVM and toolchain versions; deterministic builds; cache Gradle and Docker layers; document build environments.
