# REST Guidelines

- Resource-oriented URIs; standard verbs/status; idempotency for PUT/DELETE; 429 for throttling; 503 for overload.
- Version via `/v1` or header; advertise deprecation with Sunset headers; publish OpenAPI with examples/constraints.

# DTOs & Validation

- Strict JSON schemas; reject unknown fields; `application/problem+json` error model; include trace correlation.

# Pagination & Filtering

- Cursor-based where feasible; default/maximum limits enforced; stable sort keys; HATEOAS links when useful.
