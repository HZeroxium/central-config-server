# Feature Flags

- Typed flags with owners and expiry dates; default off; kill-switch documented; observable and auditable.
- Gate risky paths; schedule cleanup after GA; ensure flags are evaluated server-side and cached.

# Configuration

- Centralize configuration; validate at startup; allow dynamic refresh only for safe toggles; audit runtime changes.
