# HTTP Clients

- Use WebClient/RestClient with timeouts, connection pools, retries (idempotent only), circuit breakers, and metrics.
- Map external errors to domain errors; include correlation IDs; exponential backoff + jitter for retries.

# Contracts

- Pin API versions; backward-compatible adapters; consumer-driven contract tests; capture request/response samples in tests.
