# Probes

- Enable actuator probes: `management.endpoint.health.probes.enabled=true`.
- Distinct readiness vs liveness checks; readiness should gate traffic; liveness restarts only on unrecoverable states.

# Startup

- Use startup probe for slow-booting apps; higher failureThreshold for liveness; document probe thresholds.

# Safety

- Do not couple readiness to external alerts; readiness should reflect ability to serve (DB/Kafka/Redis dependencies included).
