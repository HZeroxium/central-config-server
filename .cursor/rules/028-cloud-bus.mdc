# Bus Refresh

- Enable `/actuator/busrefresh` exposure only in trusted networks; require authN/authZ; audit all triggers.
- Use Kafka or RabbitMQ transport; isolate management topics; avoid cross-tenant broadcast.

# Change Management

- Announce config change windows; attach change IDs and correlating commit SHAs.
- Blue/green test of config in staging before broadcast; define rollback config commits.

# Safety

- Use RefreshScope only for components proven safe to hot-reload; restart pods for risky changes.
- Record a post-change health snapshot (error rate, latency, GC, thread pools).
