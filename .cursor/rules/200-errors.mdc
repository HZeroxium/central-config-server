# Error Model
- Centralize exception handling; map domain/integration errors to problem+json with `traceId`, `timestamp`, `code`, `detail`, `instance`.
- Do not leak internals; client-facing messages actionable and localized where needed.

# Logging & Alerts
- Log once at the boundary; attach context; emit metrics; page on error budget burn or elevated 5xx.
