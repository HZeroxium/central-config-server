# Sources & Hierarchy
- Source of truth: Git-backed config repo; branch per environment; directory per service.
- Override order documented; environment-specific overlays only where necessary; secrets excluded.

# Client Policy
- Bind with @ConfigurationProperties; avoid @Value for complex objects; validate at startup.
- No dynamic refresh for risky properties (DB pool sizes, circuit thresholds) without guardrails.

# Profiles & Tenancy
- Profiles: local/dev/staging/prod; forbid silent fallbacks; fail fast on missing required properties.
- For multi-tenant apps, segregate tenant-level config and restrict refresh scope appropriately.
