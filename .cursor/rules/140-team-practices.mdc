# Collaboration
- PRs <300 lines changed where possible; clear titles; context, screenshots/metrics if relevant.
- CODEOWNERS enforced; at least one domain reviewer; no self-merge without prior approval.

# Knowledge
- Keep README accurate (run, test, debug, env vars, troubleshooting); update after significant changes.
- Generate docs (OpenAPI/config reference) on each release; maintain changelog for externally visible changes.
