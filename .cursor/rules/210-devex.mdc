# Developer Experience
- Provide `make` or Gradle tasks for run/test/debug; Testcontainers-first local runs; hot reload when safe.
- Seed data scripts; stable port mappings; `.env.example` for local overrides; pre-commit hooks (format, lint, fast tests, SCA).

# Troubleshooting
- Document common failures and fixes; add diagnostic endpoints guarded by profile; include sample curl/HTTPie commands.
