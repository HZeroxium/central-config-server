# Phase 5: Advanced Dashboards

Phase 5 provides advanced monitoring dashboards for SLO tracking, cost optimization, and capacity planning.

## 📊 Dashboards in This Phase

### 1. SLO Dashboards
**Purpose**: Service Level Objectives with error budgets and burn rate tracking

**Key Metrics**:
- Availability SLI and error budget
- Latency SLI with percentiles
- Error rate SLI
- Error budget burn rate
- Multi-window multi-burn alerts

### 2. Cost Optimization Dashboard
**Purpose**: Monitor resource utilization and identify cost optimization opportunities

**Key Metrics**:
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, connections)
- Instance count optimization
- Cache efficiency metrics
- Infrastructure component utilization

### 3. Capacity Planning Dashboard
**Purpose**: Plan capacity based on trends and resource utilization

**Key Metrics**:
- Traffic trends and growth rate
- Resource utilization trends
- Capacity headroom
- Scaling recommendations

## 🎯 Implementation Order

Recommended order:
1. **SLO Dashboards** - Service level objectives and error budgets
2. **Cost Optimization** - Resource optimization and efficiency
3. **Capacity Planning** - Growth trends and capacity planning

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

- **SLO Dashboards**: 4-5 hours (includes recording rules)
- **Cost Optimization**: 2-3 hours
- **Capacity Planning**: 2-3 hours

**Total**: ~8-11 hours for all Phase 5 dashboards

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 5:
